Weighted Suffix Array
===
This is the implemetation of algorithms in *Property Suffix Array with Applications in Indexing Weighted Sequences* by *P. Charalampopoulos, C. S. Iliopoulos, C. Liu and S. P. Pissis*.

In each folder we implement the algorithms: ST-PSA(sparse_table), UF-PSA(union_find) and AC-PSA(average_case).
